            <h2 class = "center">About STUDYiT!</h2>
            <p>It all began with a group of students who dreamed of making learning fun again. The struggle to do so began with the battle against the very bane of the common student - the standardized test. STUDYiT! allows students to prepare and study for AP, SAT, PSAT, and ACT exams without the usual boredom and stress. Students can now study collaboratively through competitive or non-competitive games that test their knowledge and ability to apply knowledge in given content areas. If you're a student, parent, teacher, or school administrator looking for a fresh new way to foster learning, give us a try - created by students, for students!</p>
